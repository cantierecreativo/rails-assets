          ## Bundler

          **First, make sure you use bundler >= 1.8.4**

          Add `https://#{Rails.configuration.x.hostname}` as a&nbsp;new gem source, then reference any Bower components that you need as gems in the&nbsp;following&nbsp;convention:

              source 'https://#{Rails.configuration.x.hostname}' do
                gem 'rails-assets-BOWER_PACKAGE_NAME'
              end

          During `bundle` `install`, if Bundler requests a&nbsp;package like this, Rails Assets’ daemon automatically&nbsp;will:

          * fetch the component from Bower’s&nbsp;registry,
          * analyze its manifest file, `bower.json`,
          * repackage the component as a&nbsp;valid&nbsp;Ruby gem and&nbsp;serve&nbsp;it to your application.

          Dependencies are handled the&nbsp;same way&nbsp;recursively.

          ## Asset pipeline

          You can now `require BOWER_PACKAGE_NAME` in your stylesheets and JavaScript files—all assets exposed as&nbsp;`main` in `bower.json` will be automatically&nbsp;included.

          Gems created by Rails Assets work great with any Sprockets-based application.
